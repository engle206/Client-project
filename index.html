<img src="images/MollyAvatar.jpg" alt="Molly" style="width:425px;height:300px;">
<p> Molly grew up in Naperville, Illinois where she began creating art in her childhood home. Through high school Molly created more art work and refined her skills, becoming the talented artist she is today. During her time at the University of Minnesota, Molly has taken some art classes to continue practicing new techniques. After she graduates in December she hopes to sell her artwork and become an apprentice at a tattoo shop. Please check back for updates on Molly's journey into the tattoo world! </p>

<p>Note: This website was created by Molly's roommate, and she will be updating it as more information about Molly's tattoo apprenticeship and photos of her artwork are provided. All profits from art sales go directly to Molly.</p>
